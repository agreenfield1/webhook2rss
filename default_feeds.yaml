# feeds.yaml
#
# This file defines all available feeds for the webhook2rss service.
# Each top-level key corresponds to a `feed_id`, which maps to a specific parser
# function (e.g., `parse_radarr` in parsers.py) and identifies the feed in webhook URLs.
#
# Structure:
# <feed_id>:
#   name:        (Required) A human-readable name for the feed.
#   description: (Required) A short description of what the feed does.
#   icon_url:    (Optional) A URL to a favicon or icon representing the feed.
#   url:         (Optional) A related link, shown in the RSS feed metadata.
#   token:       (Optional) A secret token required to authenticate incoming webhook POSTs.
#
# Example:
# radarr:
#   name: "Radarr Activity"
#   description: "Radarr app import feed"
#   icon_url: "http://docker.ajghs.com:7878/favicon.ico"
#   url: "http://docker.ajghs.com:7878"
#   token: snhnmxvvsqkygtfhgdvf
#
# Notes:
# - The `feed_id` must match a corresponding parser function like `parse_<feed_id>` in parsers.py.
# - Tokens are optional but recommended for securing incoming webhooks.
# - This file must be valid YAML. Strings containing special characters or colons should be quoted.
